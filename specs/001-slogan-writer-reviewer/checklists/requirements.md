# Specification Quality Checklist: Iterative Slogan Writer-Reviewer Agent System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-19  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Content Quality Assessment

- Specification describes WHAT and WHY without mentioning specific technologies (except Ollama/Microsoft Agent Framework as required dependencies)
- Focus on user experience: CLI interaction, slogan generation, agent collaboration visibility
- Language is accessible to product managers and stakeholders
- All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

- No clarification markers present - all requirements are concrete
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001 can be verified by running CLI with input)
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (e.g., "within 5 minutes", "5 turns or less", "90% of users")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (focus on user outcomes, not technical internals)
- Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format with clear verification steps
- Edge cases identified for common failure modes (empty input, connection failures, max turns, interruption)
- Scope explicitly bounded with "Out of Scope" and "Future Considerations" sections
- Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented

### Feature Readiness Assessment

- All 12 functional requirements mapped to user stories
- Three prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) enable independent development and testing
- P1 (Basic Slogan Generation) is minimal viable product
- Success criteria align with user story outcomes
- No framework-specific or implementation details in requirements

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- Architecture should consider future FastAPI extension (noted in FR-012 and Assumptions)
- Both agents use same Ollama model (simplicity principle applied)
- Clear termination conditions defined (approval or 5-turn limit)
