# Tasks: Iterative Slogan Writer-Reviewer Agent System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-slogan-writer-reviewer/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/cli-interface.md  
**Generated**: 2025-10-19

**Tests**: Not requested in specification - focusing on implementation tasks only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (P1, P2, P3) to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure per plan.md

- [ ] T001 Create project directory structure: src/{agents,orchestration,cli,config}/, tests/{unit,integration}/
- [ ] T002 Initialize Python project with uv: create pyproject.toml with dependencies (agent-framework, ollama, click, pydantic, pydantic-settings)
- [ ] T003 [P] Create .python-version file with Python 3.11+ requirement
- [ ] T004 [P] Configure Ruff for linting in pyproject.toml (line-length=100, extend-select=["I", "N", "UP"])
- [ ] T005 [P] Configure mypy for type checking in pyproject.toml (strict=true, python_version="3.11")
- [ ] T006 [P] Create README.md with project overview, installation instructions, and quick start examples

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - MVP functionality
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational AND User Story 1 (extends generate command)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (can be parallel to US2, but extends generate command)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on completion of all desired user stories

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Requires User Story 1 completion (extends the generate command with --verbose flag)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Mostly independent but adds options to generate command

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 Flow**:

1. T016-T018 (Agents) can run in parallel [P]
2. T019-T023 (Orchestration) must follow agents - T019‚ÜíT020‚ÜíT021‚ÜíT022‚ÜíT023 sequential
3. T024-T031 (CLI) follow orchestration - T024‚ÜíT025‚ÜíT026, with T027-T030 parallel [P]
4. T032-T033 (Tests) can run in parallel [P] after implementation

**User Story 2 Flow**:

1. T034 (Add flag) ‚Üí T035-T036 (Formatting, parallel [P]) ‚Üí T037-T040 sequential

**User Story 3 Flow**:

1. T041-T045 (Config/models commands) all parallel [P]
2. T046-T049 (Generate command extensions) sequential
3. T050 (Tests) independent [P]

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)** - All [P] tasks can run together:

- T003, T004, T005, T006, T007 (config files and docs)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)** - All [P] tasks can run together:

- T008, T009, T010, T012, T013, T014, T015 (all model definitions)

**User Story 1**:

- T016, T017, T018 (both agents + exports)
- T027, T028, T029, T030 (error handling + init)
- T032, T033 (tests)

**User Story 2**:

- T035, T036 (formatting functions)
- T040 (tests)

**User Story 3**:

- T041, T042, T043 (config commands)
- T050 (tests)

**Phase 6 (Polish)**:

- T051, T052, T053, T054, T055, T056, T057, T059, T060 (all documentation and quality checks)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 - Agents

```bash
# Launch both agents in parallel:
Task T016: "Implement Writer agent in src/agents/writer.py"
Task T017: "Implement Reviewer agent in src/agents/reviewer.py"
Task T018: "Create src/agents/__init__.py exports"

# All three can be developed simultaneously by different developers
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007) - 7 tasks
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T015) - 8 tasks
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T016-T033) - 18 tasks
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test with `slogan-gen generate "eco-friendly water bottle"`
5. Verify output: Final slogan appears after writer-reviewer iterations
6. **MVP Complete** - 33 tasks total for working CLI

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Setup + Foundational): Tasks T001-T015 ‚Üí Core infrastructure ready
2. **MVP Release** (+ User Story 1): Tasks T016-T033 ‚Üí Basic slogan generation working
3. **Enhanced Visibility** (+ User Story 2): Tasks T034-T040 ‚Üí Verbose iteration display
4. **Full Configuration** (+ User Story 3): Tasks T041-T050 ‚Üí Model selection and config management
5. **Production Ready** (+ Polish): Tasks T051-T064 ‚Üí Documentation, testing, quality

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Together**: Complete Phase 1 (Setup) and Phase 2 (Foundational)
2. **Once Foundational is done**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T016-T033)
   - Developer B: Can start User Story 3 models/config parts (T041-T045, T050) in parallel
3. **After User Story 1**:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (T034-T040)
   - Developer B: Complete User Story 3 (T046-T049)
4. **Together**: Polish (T051-T064)

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 64
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 8 tasks (BLOCKING)
- **Phase 3 (User Story 1 - MVP)**: 18 tasks
- **Phase 4 (User Story 2)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 5 (User Story 3)**: 10 tasks
- **Phase 6 (Polish)**: 14 tasks

**Parallel Tasks**: 28 tasks marked with [P] can run in parallel within their phase/story

**MVP Scope**: 33 tasks (Setup + Foundational + User Story 1)

**Suggested First Delivery**: Complete through Phase 3 for working MVP, then iterate

---

## Notes

- All tasks include exact file paths for clarity
- [P] tasks work on different files with no dependencies - can parallelize
- [Story] labels enable tracking which user story each task belongs to
- Each user story has a checkpoint for independent validation
- Constitution alignment: Small focused tasks (Code Quality ‚úÖ), No over-engineering (Simplicity ‚úÖ), Incremental delivery (Development Workflow ‚úÖ)
- Tests were not requested in specification, but test file structure provided in tasks for future enhancement
- Stop after any user story phase to validate and potentially deploy
